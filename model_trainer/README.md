# Prediction Model building

Build and train a Model based on Labeled images to predict a single output

## Requirements

1. save pictures inside a folder called `image_set` within label subfolders `label_a` and `label_b`

## Build the Model (one can skip building and training with calling the [main function](./main.py) with the argument: False)

1. (Optional) create a virtual environemnt `python3 -m venv venv`
2. (Optional) virtual environemnt already exists start it `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install all the dependencies stated in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start building and training `python3 main.py`
5. During the execution, windows will pop up during execution to show examples. As long as the window is open, the
   execution is paused so to continue one have to close the window
